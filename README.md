-   `@types/express`: TypeScript definitions for the Express package
-   `@types/node`: TypeScript definitions for the Node.js environment
-   `nodemon`: Automatically restarts the Node.js application when file changes are detected
-   `rimraf`: A cross-platform utility to remove files and directories
-   `ts-node`: TypeScript execution environment and REPL for Node.js
